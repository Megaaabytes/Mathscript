# TODO:

[✔] If statements

[✔] Elseif statements

[✔] Else statements

[✔] Variables

[✔] Array Variables

[❌] Proper support for variables in all commands.

[✔] Parital operator support

[❌] Full Operator support

[❌] Finish Aes Commands

[❌] Add xor operator

[✔] Variable parsing (detect if variable is array and get data from index. Also check if its a regular variable and get its data)

[✔] Command line arguments (kinda broken, as you need to run the environment executable in the command line with the script and then the arguments)

[✔] Labels

[✔] Goto command

[✔] While loops

[✔] Infinite loops and break command.

[✔] Finite loops which will automatically break after it loops enough

[✔] Variable support in Finite Loops

[✔] Proper for loops (literally the only way to make a for loop as of right now is using a few variables and a finite loop)

[✔] Manual loop break command

[✔] Switches

[✔] Length command (get length of an array and place it in an variable)

[❌] Length command (can place length output into array index)

[❌] Foreach command

[❌] Maybe external libraries?
